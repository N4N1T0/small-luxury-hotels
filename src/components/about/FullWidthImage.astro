      Arriving in Havana is like stepping into a bygone era, with an atmosphere both timeless and
      intriguing. As guests arrive, their luggage vanishes as if by magic, and they are escorted
      through each hidden corner of the hotels. Gasps of “Wow,” “Amazing,” and “Unbelievable!” are
      the soundtrack as visitors marvel at the intricate details. Inevitably, they begin asking the
      familiar questions: How long did it take to build this? How did you manage to bring in all
      this lavish furniture? Was this building in good condition when you started? Each time, the
      hoteliers offer a candid response: “It’s complicated, but not impossible. Let us tell you our
      story.” In that instant, a bond is formed—a friendship, even—between hosts and guests.
